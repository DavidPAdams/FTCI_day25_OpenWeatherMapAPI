# Open Weather Map API

## Small application consuming data from an API

In order to use this application the following steps are required:

1. Register with [Open Weather Map API](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
2. Obtain an API key
3. Add an additional property file called: application-other.properties
4. Store your API key as: api_key = [your_api_key_value]

The application-other.properties file is listed in .gitignore to prevent it from being exposed when uploading to a public repository such as Github
